            You decide to try and use the radio to attempt to contact the rest of your fleet but you soon encounter an issue.
            It appears that on your descent the radio has stopped working. 
            Luckily it seems to only be a faulty wire and after reconnecting it the display boots up.

            what you see seems to be a challange that you most solve if you wish to use the radio.
